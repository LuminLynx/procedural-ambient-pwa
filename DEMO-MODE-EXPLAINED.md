# Demo Mode Explanation

## Why Does the App Show "Demo Track"?

The **Sequencer Demo** mode is an **intentional feature showcase**, not a bug or limitation. Here's what you need to know:

## Two Modes Explained

### 1. Ambient Mode (Main Feature)
The primary mode of this application. It generates **fully procedural, infinite ambient music** with:
- Algorithmic melody generation
- Dynamic scene transitions
- Real-time audio synthesis
- Reactive visualizations
- No pre-recorded audio - everything is generated in real-time

**This is NOT a demo** - it's the complete, production-ready ambient music generator.

### 2. Sequencer Demo Mode (NEW - Sprint 3-4 Feature Showcase)
This mode demonstrates **new UI components** built in development sprints 3-4:
- Timeline View
- Mixer View  
- Piano Roll Editor
- Keyboard shortcuts (Space = play/pause, Escape = stop)

The "Demo Track" feature creates a **sample track with predefined notes** to showcase these new components.

## Why Is It Called "Demo"?

The sequencer mode is labeled as "demo" because:

1. **It's a Preview** - These are new features under active development
2. **Educational Purpose** - Demonstrates how the sequencer UI components work
3. **Not Production Ready** - The sequencer features are in beta/preview state
4. **Sample Data** - The "Add Demo Track" button creates example patterns for testing

## What's the Difference?

| Feature | Ambient Mode | Sequencer Demo |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **Purpose** | Production music generation | Feature showcase/testing |
| **Audio** | Fully procedural & infinite | User-defined patterns |
| **UI** | Simple controls | Advanced DAW-style interface |
| **Status** | Complete & production-ready | Preview/Beta features |
| **Use Case** | Listen to generated music | Test UI components |

## Future Plans

The "demo" label will be removed once:
- Full MIDI sequencer features are implemented
- Track management is complete
- Pattern editing is fully functional
- File import/export is added
- The feature set matches production quality

## How to Use Each Mode

### Ambient Mode (Not a Demo)
1. Click the "🎵 Ambient Mode" tab
2. Press "Start" 
3. Enjoy infinite, procedurally generated ambient music
4. Adjust parameters in real-time (tempo, complexity, space, etc.)

### Sequencer Demo (Preview Feature)
1. Click the "🎹 Sequencer Demo (NEW)" tab
2. Click "Initialize Audio" 
3. Click "Add Demo Track" to create a sample pattern
4. Press Play to hear the demo pattern
5. Switch between Timeline, Mixer, and Piano Roll views
6. Use keyboard shortcuts (Space, Escape)

## Removing Demo Mode

The demo track is **intentional** for testing. To experience non-demo features:
- Use **Ambient Mode** - this is the full, production feature
- Wait for sequencer features to graduate from preview/demo status

## Creating Your Own Patterns (Future Feature)

Currently, the sequencer requires the "Add Demo Track" button to populate sample data. Future updates will add:
- Manual pattern creation
- Audio/MIDI file upload
- Drag-and-drop clip creation
- Pattern libraries
- Save/load projects

## Summary

- **Ambient Mode = Production Feature** (not a demo, fully functional)
- **Sequencer Demo = Preview Feature** (intentionally labeled as demo)
- The "demo track" helps showcase and test new UI components
- This is expected behavior, not a bug

Once sequencer features are complete, the "demo" label will be removed and users will be able to create their own tracks without sample data.
